# IERG 6130 Assignment 1: Tabular Reinforcement Learning



**Due: 11:59 pm, February 5, 2020**



Welcome to the first assignment of this course! As this course assignment is still being polished, we are gratitude to your suggestion on how to improve. If you find anything confusing or incorrect no matter in codes or comments or documents, feel free to tell us via email or Github issues (the latter is preferable).

The objective of the Assignment 1 is to 

1. make you get familiar with the basic framework of reinforcement learning (RL), such as the agent-environment interaction loops. 

2. implement the basic tabular RL algorithms to solve a toy problem.

We will first go through the installation and environment setup. This assignment uses jupyter notebook as the platform for you to code. So you need to get familiar. A quicktutorial on jupyter notebook is [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/). In the first section of notebook, we take a glance of the environment and RL pipeline. In the second and third sections you are required to implement the contents of tabular RL. This document draw you your path to finish this assignment. We left sufficient information in the jupyter notebook so please walk through the file: `IERG 6130 Assignment 1.ipynb`.



## Step 1: Setup your environment

The starter codes is at: https://github.com/cuhkrlcourse/ierg6130, go through the document at the root of this repostory (namely, `README.md`) for environment setup procedures. You need to prepare such packages:

1. Python 3
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Gym
4. Numpy

If you find anything confusing, feel free to open an issue at Github. We will response to you as soon as possible. If you get stuck by some strange errors, check the Github repo since it may be fixed by our latest commits.



## Step 2: Finish the notebook

Open a shell and `cd` to current directory `ierg6130/assignment1` and start a jupyter notebook server via `jupyter notebook`. (If you do not start jupyter notebook at this directory, you may fail to import some helper function).

Open your browser and then open the `IERG 6130 Assignment 1.ipynb`

We left many `[TODO]` in the file. Following the instructions in the notebook and finish all `[TODO]`. 

Make sure your code can be run completely bug-free. Our staff will run the codes by `Restart & Run All` so make sure nothing stop the running.



## Step 3: Submit your work

Following the procedure to submit your work:

1. Before submitting, remember to fill your name and student ID into the table at the top of the file.
2. Run your codes in sequential manner, that is, run it by `Restart & Run All`. Remember to keep everything intact.
3. Generate the PDF file via `File / Download As / pdf ` to the `assignment1` directory.
4. Compress the all files in `assignment1` directory into a **zip** file, whose name follows the pattern: `"IERG6130-hw1-{name}-{id}.zip".format(name="john", id="123456")` . For instance: `IERG6130-hw1-john-123456.zip`
5. Send the **zip file** and the **PDF file** to us as **two seperated files** via email: cuhkrlcourse@googlegroups.com with title in pattern `"IERG6130-hw1-{name}-{id}-2020spring".format(name="john", id="123456")` for instance: `IERG6130-hw1-john-123456-2020spring` We will reply you a recipt email.
